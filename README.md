# Exercice JS #1

This is the first quote request form that was made for Rocket Elevators, but unfortunately the front programmer has left you with a lot of trouble. So you have a good debugging job to do!

As several employees will work to correct these problems, you are asked to make the changes on your own branch rather than on the master.

Note that only the "quote.js" file needs to be corrected. The HTML file needs no modification.

Here is the list of things to fix:

<!-- 1- The "Unit Price" field displays only the price of the Standard range -->

<!-- 2- The "N. of Elevator" field is not deleted when a mandatory field is deleted -->

<!-- 3- You can enter a negative number in the "N. of Floors" field -->

<!-- 4- The Residential calculation displays "NaN" -->

<!-- 5- The Commercial calculation should be triggered as soon as the "N. of Elevator Shaft" field is filled -->

<!-- 6- Commercial calculation displays "NaN" -->

<!-- 7- The Corporate calculation displays "NaN" -->

<!-- 8- Hybrid calculation does not work at all -->

<!-- 9- A calculation with the Premium option gives an incorrect price -->

<!-- 10- Clicking on the Standard button does not seem to redo a new calculation -->

Once this exercise is completed, you can continue with exercise Git # 3, which will allow you to validate your modifications.
